## Personal Statement #1 
What impact do you want to have on the world and why? Please limit your statement to 250 words maximum and provide your submission with a link.

This may sound a little general, but the impact I would like to have on the world would be to connect people and make everyone's lives better in some way! I love making small gestures to make the people around me happy and aim to hopefully accomplish something on a much larger scale. For example, developing an application that will users would enjoy and appreciate for years üòÅ. My favourite times have also been when I was able to connect with my friends and loved ones and I want to be able to make it easier for others to do the same!

In the winter of my junior year, my friends and I got together to design and and build an online version of our dorm room favorite boardgame - "The resistance Avalon".  It was a tradition on Friday nights, after a long week of coursework, to go out for some food and meet up at one of our apartment's to play a couple rounds of the game well into the night. This became a treasured memory for us as we went our separate ways for coop semester - many of us ended up separated in different cities. In an attempt to bring back the tradition, a project was started on github for building a realtime hosted virtual boardgame for all of us to enjoy again. Building and releasing the game was one of the most fun experiences that I had and I found a love for connecting people and programming.
